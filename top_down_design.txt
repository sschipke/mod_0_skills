How to become a Turing student

1. Investigate interest in coding and Turing
	1.1. Research or read articles on what software developers do
	1.2. Use resources such as "codecademy" to try coding and see if it is enjoyable
	1.3. Attennd a "Try Coding" weekend at Turing
		1.3.1. Use current students as a resource for information
			1.3.1.1 Inquire about the culture of the school

			1.3.1.3 Investigate what most students do for housing and transportation
		1.3.2. Use almumni as a resource
			1.3.2.1 Ask if they are glad they did the program
			1.3.2.2 Investigate what challenges they faced and how the made it through Turing
			1.3.2.3 Ask for top advice for finding a job
	1.4 Is a career in coding right for you?
		1.4.1. Consider deeply
2. Apply to Turing
	2.1. Decide which program (front end or back end)
